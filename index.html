      <h4>Singaporean Food</h4>
      <div class="divider">
      </div>
      <p>
        Due to a “myriad of coexisting food traditions” in Singapore, it is difficult to define what exactly the Singaporean cuisine is – it ranges from a simple plate of chicken rice, mee rebus, or roti prata to snacks such as curry puff, chwee kueh and many more <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. Different groups of people may have differing criteria on what is quintessentially Singaporean, what is not really Singaporean, but what we know for sure, is that <b>Singaporeans love their food</b>. As the Singapore Tourism Board declared,
        “eating is agreed to be a national passion in Singapore” and it is an “inseparable part of our culture” <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        [Singaporeans] spend a lot of time eating and thinking
        about food. Even when we are eating, we are already thinking about the next meal.
        It is an inseparable part of our culture - a quote from a former
        Minister for Trade and Industry. <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        It has long been established that “food is revealed to be central to identity at an ethnic and national level” <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>, but the question of “how” is the question our group seeks to answer. How does ingesting supposedly “Singaporean” food make one feel more “Singaporean”? What is the mechanism that creates the sense of national identity from consumption of food in our everyday lives?
      </p>

      <p>
        To further understand this mechanism, we decided to interview Singaporeans themselves to find out what they feel about Singaporean food: what is their favourite dish and why, what dishes do they consider Singaporean and why and so on. We hope that through these casual conversations about these dishes in the context of Singapore, we can identify common themes that link food and national identity. In identifying these themes, we wish to gain some insights on how exactly does consuming local food translate to sense of a national identity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, a national cuisine is also understood to be a “very fluid notion” <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>. Given the rapid globalisation Singapore has undergone by virtue of her open economy, it is thus also worth examining if such globalising forces has affected Singaporean’s conception of food and their national identity. Hence, we will also be asking people about their opinions of international food in relation to Singapore’s identity.
      </p>

      <p>
        We interviewed Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans of different races and age groups in Foodclique, Koufu in NUS, and Adam’s Road Food Centre. According to studies, hawkers contributes significantly to shape our national identity as they are often “seen as intrinsic to the Singaporean way of life” <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>. Therefore, in going to these venues, we are more likely to find Singaporeans who eat regularly in hawkers and thus have certain opinions or memories associated with local food. Then, in order to gather opinions on international food on local identity, we also interviewed some people in McDonald’s and the cafes in Serene Centre.

            <p>
              Upon analysis, our group identified three main themes that surfaced in the responses: <b>Cultural Heritage</b>, <b>Community</b> and a sense of <b>Personal Connection</b>. In each section, we will elaborate on how these themes present themselves in the responses and how they can relate to and create national identity.

            <p>The theme of Singaporean food as an artefact of our cultural heritage was something that emerged repeatedly in our interviews. Cultural heritage can be tangible (buildings, monuments), intangible (traditions, language) or natural (landscapes, biodiversity), and they are passed down from past generations in the particular group or society <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>. Cultural heritage has a strong relation to group identity formation. It is a form of “objectivised culture”, or a
              “concretion of identity” which allows a society to, through the heritage, see their history and values emerge in its “identificatory appropriation”, revealing the “constitution and tendencies of a society” <<a href="#ref7">[7]</a>. Through our interviews, it can be seen how food is regarded as a form of heritage and how it embodies certain values of Singapore.
            </p>
            <p> Several respondents described Singaporean food as being culturally diverse in nature. An interviewee in Foodclique feels that the local cuisine is a “mixture of food from different races”, and feels that that is a unique aspect of the Singapore society, as compared to say, Malaysia, which “typically only sells Malay food”. Also, a few Malaysians commented on how “kopi” and “kopi siew dai” are “very Singaporean drinks”, despite having the same kind of coffee back in Malaysia. The Singaporean-ness in this case, stems from the use of dialect in the naming. Given that Singapore has often championed herself as a multicultural nation, it can be seen from these statements that our local cuisine are viewed as a reflection of such an identity. Hence, in thinking of the local cuisine as multicultural, it evokes an essential feature of Singapore’s national identity.
            </p>

            <p>In response to another question, most of our interviewees would not classify home-cooked food as a Singaporean food. One of the reasons cited was that it was cooked in a different way from the hawkers. Another interviewee, on the topic of bak chor mee, said that “you have to go find one that truly has the Singaporean taste.”  Here, it can be implied that our respondents have a conception of an authentic Singaporean cuisine, and that it has to be prepared in a certain way. Singapore cuisine is thus viewed as a form of cultural heritage with its recipes passed down from the older generation of hawkers.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              I’ve been eating Char Kway Teow since I was born. And I’m 40 and Singapore is only 51. So I believe it’s considered our local food la.
            </blockquote>

            <p> Our respondents also often described Singaporean food as something they have been eating since they were young. A local interviewee said, “I’ve been eating Char Kway Teow since I was born. And I’m 40 and Singapore is only 51. So I believe it’s considered our local food la.” Hence, our local cuisine is seen as something that has existed for a long time, and thus forms part of our history and heritage.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              [F]rom a culture point of view, the food is borrowed from others.
            </blockquote>

            <p>However, it is not just an issue of how long the food has been in existence in Singapore. We asked some of our interviewees a hypothetical question: If cafes are still in Singapore for the next 50 years, will they consider it Singaporean food? The answer was, no. An interviewee felt that (in reference to cakes sold in cafes) “[F]rom a culture point of view, the food is borrowed from others.” Hence, the entrance of international cuisines due to globalisation does not seem to affect local cuisine. On the contrary, it seems to have brought out the contrast between foreign and local food, strengthening the local-ness of our Singaporean cuisine.</p>

            <p>With this, we see that it is also very important for a particular dish to be widely accepted by Singaporeans themselves to be truly Singaporean. The importance of such community recognition in defining local food will be elaborated on in the Community section.</p>

            <p>Given that group identity formation is at the core of our cultural heritage (url link to previous section), it is no surprise that the community around food plays a pivotal role in shaping our Singaporean identity. In fact, we believe that the study of communities’ impact and contribution to our national identity is a natural, logical extension. Through our interviews, we have observed the concept of community looming large in the background of our interviewee’s responses. </p>

            <p>When asked if home-cooked food could be classified as a Singaporean dish, many of our respondents disagreed instantly. More importantly (a concept that is related but different from that explained in the previous section), they have also alluded to the idea of availability and society-wide acceptance that prevented home-cooked food from attaining the status of “Singaporean food”. For example, Felix (whom we interviewed at Koufu) loves his homely bowl of “Bai Cai Tang” (Cabbage soup) but he would not consider it a Singaporean dish. He explained that the soup is “not popular” and Singaporeans could not “get it at hawker centres etc.” Another young student whom we interviewed at Macdonald’s also added that for a dish to be considered “Singaporean”, it has to be “available at most places and should be eaten by mainly Singaporeans.” </p>

            <p>It is thus very interesting to note how our respondents have a subconscious appeal towards what is (and is not) being widely accepted by their communities/society. They were careful to segregate what they like personally from what Singapore accepts to be an apt representation of the country. Any dish that is solely confined to the comforts of their home and not made available to other Singaporeans cannot be classified as “Singaporean food”, regardless of how delicious it might be. As a result, we can infer that availability and community acceptance of a dish serve to consolidate our shared national identity that is built upon our love for food. </p>

            <p>In addition, we have managed to sieve out another interesting insight on how community reflects the current state of things and its continued evolution. With reference to the example of “Ding Ding Tang” (given by Felix), previously a popular snack sold along the streets of Singapore in pushcarts, we are sure it would not evoke any memories amongst the younger generation of Singaporeans. True enough, we received many confused faces when we asked them if they knew about the once-famous street snack Singapore had. </p>

            <p>Granted, it is trivial to attribute the confused responses we received to the simple fact that Singapore no longer has any pushcarts selling “Ding Ding Tang”. But the more interesting insight here is that there can exist more than one group consciousness (older generation vs younger generation) at any point in time, but the conclusion would still be directed by the dominant collective consciousness of the community. And this collective consciousness of the community exists at the overlap between the different groups.</p>

            <p>With that being said, does the individual still have a role to play in shaping our national identity? Find out more in the next section on The Personal.</p>

          <div id="personal" class="col s12">
            <p>At the present point we seem to have a yardstick for judging what exactly is Singaporean food, and with that, made some inroads into determining what that says about our national identity. However, certainly few will agree that matters are as simple. What of the “very fluid notation” of national cuisine we have agreed about at the start? Similarly, if national identity is bounded by community opinions, why is it so hard to pin down an exact definition of it in the context of Singapore? We do not pretend we have a full answer to these questions. However, from our interviews, we see an interesting trend: once the bars of cultural heritage and community involvement are cleared, some of our interviewees applied their personal touch to the concept Singaporean cuisine with whatever leeway they had left. Thus, with our approach to Singaporean identity through food, we see that the final touches to our national identity is in fact, personal.</p>
            <p>Let us revisit the interview with the local interviewee who brought up Char Kway Teow as a Singaporean dish. While during the interview he rejects a homemade dish as too uncommon to be considered Singaporean, he nevertheless still mentioned personal experiences when deciding on Char Kway Teow; his in-laws have a Char Kway Teow store, and he himself operated it for a number of years.
            </p>
            <blockquote>Actually my in-laws have a stall selling CKT. And I also mastered the skill..I did operate the stall for a couple of years.
            </blockquote>
            <p>Our other interviews mirrors this trend. The young couple we’ve interviewed agrees on the community aspect of Singaporean food. However, when asked about what dish they would prefer to introduce to a visiting foreign friend, they chose dishes they typically have at home, but still could be commonly found elsewhere. Thus, a general trend we observed here was that our interviewees would not take the step to proclaim any dish they have a personal connection to as a Singaporean dish without it satisfying aforementioned factors. However, once they narrow down to a selection of what they feel most would accept as Singaporean food, they bridge the final step based on their personal experiences.
            </p>
            <p>It is perhaps unsurprising then that there is only some moderate overlap in the dishes we spoke of between the interviews. While most of our interviewees brought out a number of typical dishes --- such as Chicken Rice, or Nasi Lemak -- our conversations would nevertheless revolve around a dish with some form of personal connection. Our last interviewee for the day for example spoke of Bak Kut Teh and and Prawn Noodles, but would only consider them as Singaporean if they were of a certain variant. He associates his views to memories of his later father, who often brought him out to enjoy these dishes.
            </p>
            <p>Thus, the conclusion to draw here is that from the perspective of food, Singaporean identity is overwhelmly community based. However, given the cultural diversity in Singapore, community consensus alone leaves enough freedom for some personal interpretations of national identity. Perhaps that provides some input into why the Singaporean identity is so hard to pin down exactly at times, despite consensus that it must exist.
